            <div class="row"><p>8.24.2024 | Approaching my 40th Birthday</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>I aspire to be a lifelong learner. </p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>As I approach my 40th birthday, I want to challenge myself to remain curious; to grow my knowledge and capabilities. I want to be open to new things, and I 
            want to find ways to integrate new things into my everyday life.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>One of my biggest fears is that I will try to solve every problem with the same tried and true strategies that have always worked. Until I wake up one day, and those strategies no longer work.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p><i>“If the only tool you have is a hammer, it is tempting to treat everything as if it were a nail.” – Abraham Maslow.</i></p></div> 
            <div class="row"><p>There is a professional and a personal dimension to this aspiration.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>On a personal level, I don’t want to find myself standing in a grocery store unable to pay for my groceries because I’m using an outdated and slower payment method. I’d also prefer not to inconvenience everyone else at the 
            store because they’re waiting for me to make a transaction using an outdated method.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>At some point, I think that most of us in the United States have been behind someone in a checkout line who is writing a check. Or, a person awkwardly using a card that they can’t slide or scan. In the future, I’m not
            sure what the equivalent to this will be, but I hope I never find out.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>On a professional level, I don’t want to be the old man in the office who can’t accomplish basic tasks because he doesn’t understand how to utilize the available tools. Although I’ve done very well in my career helping 
            these exact sorts of people, I want to remain on this side of the *divide. If I cross that *divide, I may not find someone willing to help me. And, even if I do, after so long being the person who did know how to do things, I think it would
            be incredibly difficult to suddenly find myself incapable and needing help.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>I’m afraid that I’m already failing at this aspiration. There’s a lot of things that I’ve already fallen behind on. There are a few things that come to mind that have been invented, matured, and may already be outdated that 
            I don’t really understand: Discord. Slack. **GitHub. Google Pay.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>Not all changes are positive, and not all new ways of doing things are superior to the previous ways. But, it almost doesn’t matter. If society or your employer widely adopts a new approach, a person can either adopt it themselves,
            or they can resist. As time goes on, the number of resistors and the resistors’ power will inevitably decrease.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>Holding too tightly to the way things used to be is self-defeating. When the world changes, it changes. “It” doesn’t care about how hard it is for a person to catch up. “It” doesn’t care about the inconveniences and struggles a person may have. 
            “It” doesn’t even care if it leaves a person behind. The world will go on, with or without any one, and it won’t miss a single moment of sleep.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>This doesn’t happen at a single point in time. Everything is in flux all the time. I’m counting upon my aspiration to be a lifelong learner backed up with an honest effort to try (and learn) new things to protect me from obsolesce.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>* I’m not sure that divide is the correct word here. It implies two sides more strongly than I really mean.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>** This website is hosted on GitHub, and I’ve been learning about it, both through GitHub Desktop and through Git via the Windows command line. I also utilized Ruby and Jekyll to generate a static site that was published on GitHub. This was abandoned
            because I was unable with the themes I experimented with, and wanted to code it from scratch.</p></div>
            <div class="row">&nbsp;</div>
            <div class="row"><p><b>Addendum:</b></p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>Another, related thought I had while writing this post: does ageism exist because people are inflexible and unable to adapt to the changing world around them, or are people inflexible and unable to adapt to the changing world around them because 
            ageism exists and people discriminate against them? Is ageism the cause or the consequence?</p></div>
