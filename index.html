            <div class="row"><p>Over the weekend, I used an old desktop computer to set up a ProxMox server. I created several virtual machines on the server, unintentionally tracing 
            the Windows set up process. It was interesting to work backward from setting up Windows Server 2022, Windows 10, Windows 7, and Windows 98.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>One part of the Windows set up process that particular stuck with me was where it asks if you want to enter your company's name. I'm not sure why this 
            was asked -- Windows 98 was current before Active Directory existed.</p></div>

            <div class="row"><p>As I write this, I'm sitting in a cafe; it's 2:32 p.m. on a Tuesday, and I took the day off of work. Around me, there are many people 
            (mostly women) with open laptops, and presumably many of them are working remotely.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>It's a large cafe, and there's plenty of room for everyone. It doesn't appear that anyone is cramped or uncomfortable. It makes me 
            wonder, is this what work will look like in 2029? Will white collar professionals work like this every day? Or, will they communite to a company campus / 
            office, similar to the way they did in 2019.</p></div>           
            <div class="row">Opining on the relative merits of each working arrangements is way outside of the current bandwith I have for this post. I'm just reflecting upon 
            What I'm currently observing.</div>

            <div class="row"><p>I aspire to be a lifelong learner. </p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>As I approach my 40th birthday, I want to challenge myself to remain curious; to grow my knowledge and 
            capabilities. I want to be open to new experiences, and I want to find ways to integrate new things into my everyday life.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>One of my biggest fears is that I will try to solve every problem with the same tried and true strategies 
            that have always worked. Until I wake up one day, and those strategies no longer work. If I let this happen, it may be too 
            late to reverse course.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p><i>“If the only tool you have is a hammer, it is tempting to treat everything as if it were a nail.” – 
            Abraham Maslow.</i></p></div> 
            <div class="row"><p>There is a personal and a professional dimension to this aspiration, and I'd like to remain as capable 
            and relevant in each of these dimensions as possible.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>On a personal level, I don’t want to find myself standing in a grocery store unable to pay for my groceries because I’m 
            using an outdated and slower payment method. I’d also prefer not to inconvenience everyone else at the  store because they’re waiting for me 
            to finish something simple in an inefficient  manner.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>At some point, I think that most of us in the United States have been behind someone in a checkout line who is writing a check. Or, a person 
            awkwardly using a card that they can’t slide or scan. In the future, I’m not sure what the equivalent to this will be, but I hope I never find out.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>On a professional level, I don’t want to be the old man in the office who can’t accomplish basic tasks because he doesn’t understand how 
            to utilize the available tools. Although I’ve done very well in my career helping these exact sorts of people, I want to remain on this side of the 
            *divide. If I cross that *divide, I may not find someone willing to help me. And, even if I do,  it may (likely) be incredibly difficult to suddenly 
            find myself incompetent.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>Of course, purchasing items at a grocery store or working with the technology at work are only two specific examples
            of something that's much more encompassing. I aspire to not fall behind; to not become stuck in the past; to not become inflexible. I want to adapt, grow, 
            and improve.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>I’m afraid that I’m already failing at this aspiration. There’s a lot of things that I’ve already fallen behind on. There are a few 
            things that come to mind that have been invented, matured, and may already be outdated that I don’t really understand: Discord. Slack. **GitHub. Google Pay.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>Not all changes are positive, and not all new ways of doing things are superior to the previous ways. But, it almost doesn’t matter. 
            If society or your employer widely adopts a new approach, a person can either adopt it themselves, or they can resist. As time goes on, the number of 
            resistors and the resistors’ power inevitably decreases. The resistors become comedic, annoying, and ultimately, scorned and ignored.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>Holding too tightly to the way things used to be is self-defeating. When the world changes, "it" changes. “It” doesn’t care about how hard it is for a person to catch up. “It” doesn’t care about the inconveniences and struggles a person may have. 
            “It” doesn’t even care if it leaves a person behind. The world will go on, with or without any one, and it won’t miss a single moment of sleep.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>A person doesn't fall behind or become inflexible at a single point in time. Everything is in flux all the time. New things are discovered, created, and adopted
            constantly. Becoming inflexible is a decision that's made over-and-over again, each time it's just a little easier to cling to the past. I’m counting upon my aspiration to be a lifelong learner backed up with an honest effort to try (and learn) new things to protect me from obsolesce.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>* I’m not sure that divide is the correct word here. It implies two sides more strongly than I really mean.</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>** This website is hosted on GitHub, and I’ve been learning about it, both through GitHub Desktop and through Git via the Windows command line. I also utilized Ruby and Jekyll to generate a static site that was published on GitHub. This was abandoned
            because I was unable with the themes I experimented with, and wanted to code it from scratch.</p></div>
            <div class="row">&nbsp;</div>
            <div class="row"><p><b>Addendum:</b></p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>Another, related thought I had while writing this post: does ageism exist because people are inflexible and unable to adapt to the 
            changing world around them, or are people inflexible and unable to adapt to the changing world around them causing people discriminate against them? Is ageism the cause or the consequence?</p></div>
