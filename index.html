            <div class="row"><p>But, when I think about the people I know, most of them have not been lifelong learners. And, it makes me wonder
            if this not something they valued? Did they not also want to be lifelong learners? Did they reach a point at which they decided that new skills
            were too difficult to learn? That new strategies for solving problems weren't worth seeking out because all their existing strategies worked well 
            enough?</p></div>
            <div class="row"><p>Do I just know too many of the wrong type of people?</p>
            <div class="row"><p>Another, similar thought: does ageism exist because people are inflexible and unable to adapt to the changing world around them, or
            are people inflexible and unable to adapt to the changing world around them because ageism exists and people discriminate against them? Is ageism the 
            cause or the consequence?</p>
            <div class="row"><p>So, why didn't it happen for them? And, will I fall into the same traps?</p></div>
